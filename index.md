# About Me
Currently I am third year Ph.D student in computer science at [Universit√§t Hamburg](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/cong/). In 2014, I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in **Mechatronic Engineering** from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). After that I started my postgraduate at [The State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems](http://en.hit.edu.cn/post/detail/3602). My [master thesis](http://gb.oversea.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?filename=1017739899.nh&dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFDREF) focuses on the control system and algorithm of the Exoskeleton Robots. In 2017, I became a Ph.D. candidate in **Artificial Intelligence and Robotics**. I enjoy all the mathematics derivation and programing process in machine learning. Welcome to my research blogs [here](blog) and feel free to discuss with me. Here is a [brief CV](data/personal/LinCong_CV.pdf) of mine.
